# Chat App

Welcome to my first **Chat App**!  
It may be minimal and have some quirks, but itâ€™s a start, and Iâ€™m excited to share it with you. ðŸŽ‰

## Features in Progress

I have many plans to make this chat app better in the future. Below is a list of some enhancements and improvements I hope to implement soon.

### 1. **User Experience Enhancements**

- **User List**: Display a list of connected users so participants can see who is online.
- **Typing Indicator**: Show when another user is typing to improve real-time interaction.
- **Message Read Receipts**: Indicate when a message has been read by the recipient.
- **Emojis and Reactions**: Allow users to send emojis or react to messages for fun and better communication.
- **Dark Mode/Light Mode**: Provide a theme switcher for better visual comfort based on user preference.
- **Customizable User Profiles**: Allow users to set profile pictures and status messages for personalization.

### 2. **Functional Features**

- **Message History**: Store chat history on the server-side and retrieve it when users connect.
- **Private Messaging**: Enable direct messaging between users for private conversations.
- **File Sharing**: Support sending images, documents, and other file types within the chat.
- **Search Functionality**: Allow users to search through past messages for easy access to information.
- **Notification System**: Implement browser notifications for new messages, even when the app is not in focus.

### 3. **Security Features**

- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication (e.g., login system) to restrict access to authorized users.
- **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize user inputs to prevent malicious attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **TLS/SSL Encryption**: Secure WebSocket communication using `wss://` (WebSocket Secure) for data integrity and protection.

### 4. **Server-Side Improvements**

- **User Rooms/Channels**: Create different chat rooms or channels where users can join specific conversations.
- **Admin Controls**: Provide admin functionality to manage users, moderate the chat, or control rooms.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam by limiting the rate at which users can send messages.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track app usage statistics such as the number of messages sent and active users.

### 5. **Integration with Third-Party Services**

- **Bots and Integrations**: Integrate bots for automated responses or helpful functionalities (e.g., weather updates, news).
- **APIs**: Connect external APIs (like a translation service) to enable multilingual chat support.
- **Payment Processing**: If applicable, integrate payment systems for in-app transactions, such as sending virtual gifts.

### 6. **Accessibility Features**

- **Screen Reader Support**: Ensure the app is accessible to users with visual impairments.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Allow full navigation through the app using keyboard shortcuts for ease of use.
